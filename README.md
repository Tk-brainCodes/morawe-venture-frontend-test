# Candidate Dashboard Project

Welcome to the Candidate Dashboard Project! This is a responsive and interactive web application designed to display and filter candidates based on various criteria. The dashboard is built using modern web technologies that focus on performance, scalability, and a smooth user experience.

## Tech Stack

### 1. **Next.js** (React Framework)
   - **Why Next.js?**  
     Next.js is a powerful React framework that provides a lot of built-in features, including server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, and more. It's ideal for building fast and scalable applications.
   - **Benefits**:
     - **SSR and SSG**: Automatically handles rendering on the server side and static site generation, ensuring better performance and SEO.
     - **File-based Routing**: Simplifies routing by automatically mapping file structure to routes.
     - **Optimized Performance**: Automatic code-splitting and lazy loading for faster initial loads.

### 2. **TypeScript**
   - **Why TypeScript?**  
     TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript. It brings type safety to JavaScript, reducing the chances of bugs and improving code maintainability.
   - **Benefits**:
     - **Static Typing**: Helps to catch potential errors during development.
     - **Improved Developer Experience**: Provides autocompletion, type checking, and better refactoring tools.
     - **Better Scalability**: TypeScript's type system makes it easier to scale and maintain the application as it grows.

### 3. **Tailwind CSS**
   - **Why Tailwind CSS?**  
     Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to design your web applications without having to leave your HTML or JSX.
   - **Benefits**:
     - **Fast Styling**: With Tailwind, you can build responsive, custom designs directly in your markup, significantly speeding up the development process.
     - **Customizability**: Tailwind's configuration allows you to extend and customize the default design system to suit your needs.
     - **Utility-First Approach**: Allows for flexible and reusable components without the need for writing complex custom CSS.

### 4. **Framer Motion**
   - **Why Framer Motion?**  
     Framer Motion is a popular animation library for React that makes it easy to create smooth and interactive animations and transitions.
   - **Benefits**:
     - **Declarative Animations**: Animations are simple to implement with a declarative API, making them easier to control and manage.
     - **Performance**: It is optimized for performance and ensures smooth animations, even on mobile devices.
     - **Customizable Transitions**: Allows for fine-grained control over animation timing, easing, and sequencing.

### 5. **Shadcn UI**
   - **Why Shadcn UI?**  
     Shadcn UI is a set of modern, customizable, and responsive UI components for React. It integrates seamlessly with Tailwind CSS to create beautifully designed interfaces.
   - **Benefits**:
     - **Pre-built Components**: Save time by using pre-styled, customizable components.
     - **Tailwind Integration**: Leverages Tailwind's utility-first approach, allowing for easy customization without writing custom CSS.
     - **Accessibility**: Ensures that the UI components are built with accessibility in mind.

### 6. **Context API**
   - **Why Context API?**  
     React's Context API is used to manage and share state across the application without the need for prop drilling. It simplifies state management, especially for global states like authentication, theme, or search filters.
   - **Benefits**:
     - **Global State Management**: Easily share data across multiple components without passing props manually.
     - **Simplicity**: Provides a lightweight solution for state management, especially compared to more complex solutions like Redux.
